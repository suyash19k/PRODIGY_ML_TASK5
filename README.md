Introduction
The goal of this project is to create a deep learning model that can identify various food items from images and estimate their calorie content. This model can be useful for health and fitness applications, where users need to monitor their food intake and make healthier dietary choices.


Usage
Data Preprocessing
Run the data_preprocessing.ipynb notebook to preprocess the dataset.

Model Training
To train the model, use the train.py script:

bash
Copy code
python src/train.py --data_dir data --output_dir model_output
Model Evaluation
Evaluate the trained model using the evaluate.py script:

bash
Copy code
python src/evaluate.py --model_path model_output/best_model.pth --data_dir data/val
Model Inference
Use the trained model for inference on new images:

python
Copy code
from src.model import load_model, predict

model = load_model('model_output/best_model.pth')
image_path = 'path/to/your/image.jpg'
prediction, calories = predict(model, image_path)

print(f"Predicted Food: {prediction}, Estimated Calories: {calories}")
